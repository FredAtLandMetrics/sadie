==About Sadie

Sadie is a general-purpose data server written in Ruby and it's intended to be used by developers to simplify access to inter-related data sets.

It is designed to provide handle-based access to data of all types, much like a simple hash.

It runs as a daemon and can be communicated with via a RESTful interface.

Sadie can be downloaded via its rubygems page[https://rubygems.org/gems/sadie] or from github[https://github.com/FredAtLandMetrics/sadie].
