[setDestroyTimer]  this will accept either a quantity of time or a specific date and
                   will destroy the data at that time, causing a "reprime" event
                   
[threadedness]     split getSadieInstance(sessionid] into getSadieInstanceSlave[sessionid]
                   where getSadieInstance will continute to bring up a normal Sadie
                   instance and getSadieInstanceSlave will perform reads in its own thread
                   but will prime in sync with the main instance thread (such that two
                   primers for the same key would never execute at the same time, rather,
                   the second one would simply block until the first completed).  This
                   would allow for some concurrency within a session without.  Rather than
                   calling getSadieInstanceSlave directly, a prgram could simple call a
                   new method, consider( key ) which would fire off a get in an instance
                   slave to allow for some background processing
                   
[keyregexpmatch]   instead of requiring that all keys must be known either as having been set
                   or having a known primer, a key could be matched against a regex.
                   This would make it possible to encode some useful priming information
                   in the key itself, enough that the primer could use it and divine the
                   desired result.  So, where Sadie::prime takes an arg of containing
                   a list of keys that this primer "provides", it will alternatively take an
                   arg of "key-match" which will fire off the primer when the key matches.
                   
[sampleapps]       make a few simple apps with primer directories 

[primer_path]      currently defined via a path to a single directory, the toplevel primer
                   directory idea should be made into a collection of directories as spec'ed
                   in a colon-separated list, and it should check the environment, if
                   otherwise undefined.  would make it easy to have multiple primer
                   repositories.
